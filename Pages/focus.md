## Forgetting things

Our brains wired to forgetting things. Students will forget half of what they learn. In a day they will remember only one third of it. And it doesn't stop there.

- Tip #1: Use peer-to-peer explanations
When students explain what they've learned, fading concepts are retrieved, strengthened, and consolidated.

- Tip #2: Review, break, review again.
Studies confirm that students remember more when the key lessons are reviewed through out the year.

- Tip #3: Give frequent practice (mock) tests.
Dozens of studies show that frequent tests boost long term reattention and reduce test stress.

- Tip #4: Try interleaving
Don't group similar concepts and problems together. Mix them up so students think on their feet which encodes learning more deeply.

- Tip #5: Pair texts with images
Use images that reinforce written material to buttress learning. It's easier to remember what have been learned and seen.
Forgetting starts as soon as learning. So use this tips to stick things to your mind.
