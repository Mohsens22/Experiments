# Focus

We procrastinate cuz we can find a way to get rid of tasks. Intelligent people find intelligent ways to get rid of unwilling tasks.

## What makes us loose focus

Let's look at how brain focuses on something:

1. The senses take all the information around us indiscriminately.
2. The brain ranks all the information it recieves, based on whar it thinks is important at the moment(You can manipulate this). Anything unimportant is discarded.
3. The brain then chooses which of the important information should be the top priority (this can be manipulated as well). Sometimes this is a conscious decision, but more often this happen unconsciously by habit.

Three main factors can distract us from being focused:

1. **External factors** such as noise, bothersome co-workers, children, TV, internet etc.
2. **Internal factors** such as annoying thoughts, unwilling ideas etc.
3. **Health problems** such as ADHD, liver problems, hemoconcentration etc.

### Overcome external factors

There are some easy tips that can minimize external distraction factors:

#### Reduce information overload (reduce unwanted information getting to you)

1. Disconnect from the world
2. Control how much information gets pushed to you. (Limit and control)
3. Minimise distracting things as much as possible.

Technology, phone and social media is evil. Just ingore them in your mandatory slices of your time sheets. Instead allocate time for it at the end of the day after your important works. (NOT BEFORE)

#### Know what's important

1. Prioritize your work
2. Limit your day into 2-3 main tasks (mandatory tasks)

#### Conserve your willpower

1. Break down big, scary tasks into smaller, easier tasks.
2. Set mini deadline for tasks.
3. Reward yourself after doing everytasks. If you did wrong, punish yourself by insulting yourself in the morror!

### Internal factors

There are two types of internal factors that can make distractions for us:

1. Bad thought
2. Annoying thought

#### Getting rid of bad thought

During the day we sometimes thing about some tasks which are like deadly weanom for your brain. Let's see some examples:

- I can't do this
- I'm bad at math, what's the point of studying?
- I'm lazy
- I'm asshole
- I'm not attractive
- I hate apples
- I have hyrophobia. I won't swim.
- No body loves me
- Mind masterbation (Reviewing something pointless that happened in the past)
- etc.

These thoughts are always bad and they ain't gonna help you. All we can do is to get thefuck rid of these thoughts. Here are some thechniques to use. Note that you might need to use mixture of them:

> **First you need to accept that this thought is bad and you need to get rid of it and something else is the truth**

##### Write Write Write Burn!

Write down that thought for 1000 at least times papers till the time you get board of it. Then burn it.

##### Write, look and make fun of it

Making fun of something that you fear, dislike or you know that's not true. Write it on a board with a big font size and see that for some minutes then make fun of it.

##### Be your own interviewer

Folow this template and say it loud when you had a bad thought:

> I am {your name} here is {the place} at {date and time}. I'm thinking of {the thought} which is total bulshit and I need to change my mind about thid fucking shit. This thought is just crazy and it's distracting me with no reason. I must stop this.

#### About annoying thought

Annoying thoughts are not bad thought. They are mostly beneficial, but they come in a wrong moment. It happened alot that you are working but you remember that you must pay the bills, send invoice, fix the car, email a co-worker, call your girlfriend or buy something online. They are not bad thoughts but they come into your head in a wrong moment. The keys is here **They come into your head because they are important. So make time for them out of your working hours.** In conclusion, when you had an annoying thought, know that something is wrong with your time management and writing habits so you need to make time and improve.

#### Getting rid of unwilling ideas duing the work

Sometimes you have great ideas in your head, but they come in a wrong moment that distract you from working. Here are some tips:

1. Take fucking note of ideas with full details.
2. Stick to work hours.
3. Make work hours if you have evil flexible work hours.
4. Be boss of yourself. Mandate !
5. Make dedicated time for ideas.
6. Let ideas grow

#### Evil is in between

When you want to do something, but you don't feel of doing that, thats **IN BETWEEN**.
Next time when you faced in-between, pretend that it's evil. Yell "in-between" and go crazy. Then go fucking do that task.
Sometimes it's not important how we feel. What we do is important.



> 3 second rule: after 3 seconds of in-between go ahead and act.

### Health

Don't expect your mind to work well if something is wrong with your body. Some illnesses like **AHDH** and **hemoconcentration** can effect your attention directly. Other types of sickness like lack of vitamins can make you tired and decrease your intelligence level and make your body weak, so it makes harder for you to focus.

Whenever you had any problems or signs of sickness, visit your doctor before you get into a serious problem.

#### Exercise

Exercise helps trigger endorphins, which improve the prioritizing functions of the brain. After exercise, your ability to sort out priorities improves, allowing you to block out distractions and better concentrate on the task at hand. Your brain remembers more when your body is active. So work out and let your brain work better.

#### Food

Healty food, sea food, protein, nuts, vegetables, fruits lile strawberry and sweet drinks like juices can help your mind to concentrate. So care more about your eating habits.

## Forgetting things

Our brains wired to forgetting things. Students will forget half of what they learn. In a day they will remember only one third of it. And it doesn't stop there.

- Tip #1: Use peer-to-peer explanations
When students explain what they've learned, fading concepts are retrieved, strengthened, and consolidated.

- Tip #2: Review, break, review again.
Studies confirm that students remember more when the key lessons are reviewed through out the year.

- Tip #3: Give frequent practice (mock) tests.
Dozens of studies show that frequent tests boost long term reattention and reduce test stress.

- Tip #4: Try interleaving
Don't group similar concepts and problems together. Mix them up so students think on their feet which encodes learning more deeply.

- Tip #5: Pair texts with images
Use images that reinforce written material to buttress learning. It's easier to remember what have been learned and seen.
Forgetting starts as soon as learning. So use this tips to stick things to your mind.

## Notes

Take notes while you are studying. It increases your learning rate. Don’t spend two hours studying. Review parts of your notes for ten to twenty minutes before you go to bed on a regular basis. You might try things like making your notes into flashcards or creating mock exams from them. It’s amazing how much you learn when you create the evaluation tool. Focus is nothing except acting and learning from mistakes.
