# Choice theory

The 1998 book, Choice Theory: A New Psychology of Personal Freedom, is the primary text for all that is taught by The William Glasser Institute. Choice theory states that:

- all we do is behave,
- that almost all behavior is chosen, and
- that we are driven by our genes to satisfy five basic needs: · Power (which includes achievement and feeling worthwhile as well as winning).
     - **Love & Belonging** (includes groups as well as families or loved ones).
    - **Freedom** (includes independence, autonomy, your own ‘space’).
    - **Fun** (includes pleasure and enjoyment).
    - **Survival** (includes nourishment, shelter, sex).

In practice, the most important need is love and belonging, as closeness and connectedness with the people we care about is a requisite for satisfying all of the needs.

## Concepts

A basic understanding of Choice Theory requires some knowledge of the following 5 key concepts:

1. Basic Needs
2. The Quality World
3. Reality & Perception
4. Comparing Place
5. Total Behavior

### Choice Theory: The Quality World

>Each of us develops a unique Quality World, the source of all motivation.

Whereas the Basic Needs represent  “nature,” The Quality World represents “nurture.” As we live our lives and interact with others, we each build this unique Quality World that includes the people, activities, values, and beliefs that are most important to us as individuals.

Everything we place in our Quality World is need satisfying.

Examples:

- I love these people.
- I feel a sense of power when I am singing on stage.
- I have fun when I am playing outside with my children.

Throughout our lives, we add and delete “pictures” from our Quality World. Some people develop Quality World pictures that are unhealthy and irresponsible.

Examples:

- Think of people who only feel a sense of power or freedom when drinking alcohol or taking other drugs.
- Think of people who have fun when hurting others physically or emotionally.

Choice Theory suggests that parents, educators, and the community at large can promote environments that encourage others to develop Quality World pictures that let them satisfy their needs responsibly.

### Choice Theory: Reality & Perception

>Even though we all live in the Real World, Choice Theory contends that what matters is our perception of reality.

We behave based on what we perceive to be real, whether we are right or wrong.

Choice Theory states that information passes through three distinct filters as we create our perception of reality:

1. the sensory filter
2. the knowledge filter
3. the value filter

Because of these filters, two or more people may witness the same event or participate in the same activity and develop radically different perceptions.

Examples:

- We may all agree that Barack Obama is president of the United States, but there are multiple perceptions about how “good” or bad” a president he is.
- Talk to a couple of Red Sox and Yankee fans and you’ll quickly understand that the same “real world” is perceived very differently because of their value filters.

### Choice Theory: The Comparing Place

Our brain continually compares two images:

1. our perception of reality
2. our Quality World picture of what we want at that moment

The purpose of all behavior is to create a match between what we perceive and what we want.

When there is a match, we will maintain the behaviors we have chosen. When there is enough of a mismatch to cause internal discomfort, we automatically search for new behaviors that will create the match we seek.

Examples:

- A classroom teacher looks around the room and notices that the students are actively involved in the activity she has asked them to do. She gets a positive internal signal and continues her current teaching strategies
- A parent notices that their child is behaving poorly at home and in school. The mismatch between what the parent wants and what they perceive leads them to try new strategies designed to help the child behave more responsibly.

### Choice Theory: Total Behavior

All behavior has four components:
1. acting
2. thinking
3. feeling
4. physiology

When we change any one component of behavior, the other components change as well.

The two easiest components to control directly are acting and thinking. It is virtually impossible to change your feelings or physiology directly.

Examples:

- Imagine you could feel less sad or depressed just because you wanted to.
- Imagine a student who is agitated and frustrated and could just calm down because he wanted to.

Since all four components work in concert, however, we have much more control over our feelings and physiology than we realize. By choosing to act and/or think differently, our feelings and physiology automatically change.

Practitioners of Choice Theory help people choose responsible actions and thoughts that lead them to feel better and positively impact their physiology.

## Detail

We have 4 main relationships that we should care about:

- Relationship with our employer (and co-workers)
- Relationship with our parents
- Relationship with our partner
- Relationship with your teacher

If you have any problems in any of these 4 relationships, your life will be like a total hell. So if any, go on and fix your relations.

The hell about relationships happens when someone wants to force someone else todo something that he doesn't like to do so. That's called **External Control**. Dictating and controlling other never gonna work.

Choice theory, with the Seven Caring Habits, replaces external control psychology and the Seven Deadly Habits. External control, the present psychology of almost all people in the world, is destructive to relationships. When used, it will destroy the ability of one or both to find satisfaction in that relationship and will result in a disconnection from each other. Being disconnected is the source of almost all human problems such as what is called mental illness, drug addiction, violence, crime, school failure, spousal abuse, to mention a few.

## Relationships and our Habits

Seven Caring Habits| Seven Deadly Habits
--- | ---
1. Supporting | 1. Criticizing
2. Encouraging | 2. Blaming
3. Listening | 3. Complaining
4. Accepting | 4. Nagging
5. Trusting | 5. Threatening
6. Respecting | 6. Punishing
7. Negotiating differences | 7 .Bribing, rewarding to control

## The Ten Axioms of Choice Theory

1. The only person whose behavior we can control is our own.
2. All we can give another person is information.
3. All long-lasting psychological problems are relationship problems.
4. The problem relationship is always part of our present life.
5. What happened in the past has everything to do with what we are today, but we can only satisfy our basic needs right now and plan to continue satisfying them in the future.
6. We can only satisfy our needs by satisfying the pictures in our Quality World (Quality world is a perfect world that we have in our mind).
7. All we do is behave.
8. All behavior is Total Behavior and is made up of four components: acting, thinking, feeling and physiology.
9. All Total Behavior is chosen, but we only have direct control over the acting and thinking components. We can only control our feeling and physiology indirectly through how we choose to act and think. For example if we choose the behavior "Running" our acting is to walk so fast, we feel and think better and our body physiology changes due to working out.
10. All Total Behavior is designated by verbs (depressing, angering, aggressing, running, walking, etc) and named by the part that is the most recognizable.

Note that depression and stuff like that are behaviors.Means that they're chosen by people not dictated from outside. But as they are feelings, we can't have a direct impact on it. We must do something "*choose a behavior*" to get rid of sadness.

## Choice theory tips about your child

1. **Focus on the present**. Avoid discussing the past (that's called mind masturbation). It is the source of all trouble. All human problems are caused by an unhappy present relationship. No point talking about past unsatisfying relationships. Why? It triggers the 7 deadly habits of criticizing, blaming, complaining, nagging, threatening, punishing, bribing, or rewarding to control.
2. As soon as you can, find who are the people the child is disconnected to. It is not easy to do it as a parent, as most of the time it is one or two of the parents. This is why it is best for parents to work on themselves first and help them connect to their kids (by then, the child is no longer disconnected). I have a client who is going through a relationship crisis with his wife, and his son, a 14-year-old, is very angry, aggressive, and uses many swear words at home (no one in the house does). One of this client’s goals was to have a better relationship with his son. It took only one session to find out that his son is seeking a better relationship with him (mum is home and dad is the one threatening to leave). The following session, we worked on my client’s challenge in connecting with his son. When he came to the third session, the child was a happy, respectful child. It doesn’t take long, but parents need courage to take responsibility over their relationship with their kids.
3. If it doesn’t work to re-connect, help them find new connections and be strong enough to accept that others can help them greatly. It can be friends, teachers, and other family members. I myself found that other family members are very good connection with my kids. As long as you don’t see other connections as a threat to yours, you’ll be fine.
4. No matter what you do, avoid criticizing, blaming or complaining! Teach your child to avoid criticizing, blaming, or complaining and make sure you are a good model.
5. Understand what “total behavior” is. Focus on acting and thinking. It is the only thing we can control directly. Any person who needs therapy seeks some sense of control. Focus on what they can do, not on what they can’t do.
6. Help your child change feeling and physiology by changing the thinking and action.
7. Stay non-judgmental at all times. Refrain from using force and pressure to make your child do things. It is a bad modeling of the deadly habits.
8. Encourage your child to be reflective. Be careful not to confuse judging self with being reflective. When they examine their action themselves, they are reflective. When you are pushing them to come up to a specific conclusion, you are using them to judge themselves.
9. Teach them to ask the questions: Is what I am doing getting me closer to the people I need? Remember, love and belonging are the heart of the needs. They have a problem because they are disconnected somehow. They need to constantly reflect and ask themselves if what they do works for them or not. They don’t need your judgment on it. They need their understanding of it.
10. Help your child find new behaviors that will help him connect. Remember, do not force. Be gentle and caring. Offer, suggest, respect them, and let them choose!
11. Teach your kids that excuses and justifications of things that are not good and not working contribute to their helplessness and are obstacles to their ability to connect. Yes, we need it sometimes when we feel the responsibility is too heavy, but responsibility is power!
12. Help your child develop a plan (goal, milestones, or celebration) to reconnect with the people they need. Help them follow through and evaluate their own progress. You can suggest a plan but never force it. The kid must have ownership of the plan and believe he can do it. When working on a plan, make sure the child understands the plan is flexible and  there are many options for a plan. The child can choose the one that best suits his/her style and it can be changed at any time. It’s not carved in stone!
13. When working with your kids, you can teach choice theory as a way of saying, “It is not me. It is not manipulation. It is a theory that works really well, and it is external to us“. It helps kids understand that many other families have the same experiences and they are just normal.

## Choice theory at work

Glasser’s work differentiates itself from other management approaches because it can have a tangible effect on workplace quality and employee engagement. I’ve seen firsthand how powerful lessons from Choice Theory can be in the workplace.

Recently, a good friend of mine was struggling to get an employee to move to Phoenix. My friend wanted the employee to move because that’s where everyone else was located, but he was looking at the situation solely from his own perspective as a CEO. I saw an immediate parallel and introduced my friend to Glasser’s WDEP technique:

- What do you **want**?
- What **direction** are you going?
- **Evaluate** whether your actions are taking you in the right direction.
- Discuss, revise and refine your **plan**.

This paradigm shift allowed my friend to set aside his instincts to control the situation and instead understand the relocation issue from his hesitant employee’s perspective.

As I said earlier, other people can’t control us unless we allow them to. We always have a choice of how we feel, act and respond to situations. Managers certainly can use their authority to make an employee act — potential termination can be a significant motivator — but that employee still has the option to quit his job or not show up for work. Any action motivated by fear breeds unhappiness that has a way of worming its way through an entire organization.

My friend’s employee ultimately chose to move to Phoenix, and he felt genuinely enthusiastic about it rather than forced into something he didn’t want. How many managers can claim to accomplish goals without imposing their will?

### Applying ‘theory’ to the workplace

Putting management theories into practice is notoriously tricky. It’s easy to see what you should do, but actually taking those steps is another matter entirely. Here are four ways Choice Theory can benefit any enterprise:

1. **Stop being a boss. Start being a leader**: Many leaders adopt a laissez-faire approach and only jump into action when problems emerge. Glasser draws a line in the sand between being “a boss” and what he terms a “lead manager”. Lead managers persistently strive to create a non-coercive environment. By encouraging employees to self-evaluate, strive for greatness and talk through any trust issues, lead managers accomplish more with less prodding.

2. **Understand your employees’ quality worlds**: Glasser encourages managers to understand the “quality world” their employees occupy — the people they want to be with, the things they want to own or experience, and the concepts or belief systems that govern their behavior. Hold a monthly meeting with employees to give them a chance to carefully consider the relationship of the company to their individual quality worlds. This simple step will help you foster engagement organically rather than through coercion.

3. **Apply WDEP to solve problems**: It’s easy to feel a compulsion to rush in and fix any problems that arise in a workplace, but you’re much better served to use WDEP to address underlying issues. Encourage employees to think about what they want, what they are doing to achieve that goal, how they measure their progress, and whether they need to change their strategies in any way. This encourages employees to take ownership of problems and allows them to feel like important, empowered components of the organization.

4. **Know your employees’ basic needs**: Glasser claims every person has five basic needs that motivate all behavior: love and belonging, survival, power, freedom, and fun. Understand the substance of these needs, and use them as the foundation for a dynamic team. For instance, pairing someone with a high need for survival with someone who has a high need for power can help both parties flourish naturally. Meanwhile, a team of two power-focused individuals can quickly dominate a workplace. Offer each employee an assessment of his needs to reveal the items that have a significant effect on his workplace performance.

## How choice theory impacts learning

>When Choice Theory is applied in the classroom, as it has been in schools across the world, it has a significant impact on how instruction is delivered.

### The Teacher As Manager

[Glasser contends that teachers need to manage effectively if they hope to successfully teach their students.](http://wglasser.com/?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=29)

The role of the teacher/manager is to help students see that working hard and doing what the teacher asks is worth the effort and will add quality to their lives. This is achieved by developing positive relationships with students and providing active, relevant learning experiences where students can demonstrate success.

Effective teacher/managers create shared Quality World pictures with their students so students are motivated to learn what the teacher wants to teach.

### The Needs-Satisfying Classroom

When creating lessons, teachers who practice Choice Theory ensure that students can satisfy their needs by doing what the teacher asks them to do.

Learning increases and disruption diminishes when students know that they are able to connect, feel a sense of competence and power, have some freedom, and enjoy themselves in a safe, secure environment. (Chapter 10 of [The Motivated Student: Unlocking the Enthusiasm for Learning](http://www.amazon.com/Motivated-Student-Unlocking-Enthusiasm-Learning/dp/1416608109/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1281123132&sr=8-1-spell) offers a specific strategy that helps teachers plan lessons with their students’ needs in mind)

### Common Characteristics

Classrooms and schools that apply Choice Theory share the following 3 characteristics:

1. **Coercion is minimized**. Rather than trying to “make” students behave by using rewards and punishments, teachers build positive relationships with their students, managing them without coercion. Coercion never inspires quality.

2. **Focus on quality**. Teachers expect mastery of concepts and encourage students to re-take tests and continue to work on assignments until they have demonstrated competence or quality. The emphasis is on deep learning demonstrated through the ability to apply what has been learned.

3. **Self-evaluation**. Self-evaluation is a cornerstone of Choice Theory. Given helpful information (rubrics, models, exemplars, etc.) students take on greater ownership of their learning by evaluating their own performance routinely. Encouraging students to self-evaluate promotes responsibility and helps students pursue goals and become skilled decision-makers because they are more actively involved in their education.
