# Time management

The most valuable thing that we have in our life is out time. Here is a tip to manage your time more effectively.

## Know about time categories

Over the course of the month, I’d track over 43,000 minutes. I needed to come up with some general categories of where my time went in order to be able to label each time entry and make that data meaningful.

So, I thought about my life and the areas where I wanted to devote time to. After some brainstorming, I landed on the following eight categories:

1. Paid work (e.g., freelance clients)
2. Passion work (e.g., side projects)
3. Professional development (e.g., business development, networking, job applications)
4. Personal development (e.g., journaling, classes or workshops, inspiring reading)
5. Relationships (e.g., spending time with family, phone calls with friends, dates)
6. Play (e.g., shopping, TV, casual reading, going out)
7. Wellness (e.g., working out, taking necessary breaks, self care)
8. Support work (e.g., volunteering, mentoring)

I also had to get real and create a couple categories for areas I knew some of my time went to, even if I wasn’t thrilled about that fact. These included:

9. Distractions (e.g., flipping through social media mindlessly, taking extra time to get out of bed in the morning)
10. Maintenance (e.g., running errands, getting ready, doing chores)

While I tracked sleep to make sure I accurately kept up with 24 hours in a day, I didn't include it in my analysis because I know it accounts for about a third of my time and don’t want to change that. If cutting back on sleep to make room for other things interests you, it might be worth tracking here, too. I decided to focus just on how I spend my waking hours.

Most of these categories probably apply to everyone, but yours may be a little different. Do your best to come up with areas you think your time goes to—or want it to go to, even if you’re not actually focusing on them that right now. Try to keep it to around 10 categories so you don’t get overwhelmed with options.

## Determine Your Ideal Allocation of Time

While I wanted to do my best to not judge how I was spending my time during the experiment—to just track it as it is and analyze at the end—I did want to have a baseline to compare my results to. This wasn't a hypothesis of how I spend my time, but more of a vision for how I would like my time to be allocated.

When doing this exercise, think about how many hours in a week you want to spend doing something and figure out a percentage from there. The reason a week might be more meaningful than a day is that things can differ a lot day to day—weekends are different from weekday, for example—but are usually pretty normalized week over week.

Let yourself be aspirational here and really imagine how you want to “spend your life,” but also be realistic. If you work a 9-to-5 job and don’t plan on changing that anytime soon, then paid work will need to account for about 40 hours of your weeks or about 36% of your waking time.

> Ed. Note: You can apply this strategy to get a clearer breakdown of where your time goes at work, too. Just adjust the categories to break the workday into types of tasks.

## Divide your day into hourly slices

Assume that you wake up at 7 AM and you sleep at 11 PM. then you have 16 slices of time to work. Assign tasks and missions to each slice and make a worksheet like this:

`#`|Task|`#`|Task
--|--|--|--|--
7| Take pills, Take shower, breakfast|15|Work: (The task you have)
8|Drive work|16|Work: (The task you have)
9|Work: (The task you have)|17|Drive home
10|Work: (The task you have)|18|Take rest - work out
11|Work: (The task you have)|19|Practice guitar
12|Work: (The task you have)|20|Watch blah blah movie
13|Work: (The task you have)|21|Me time
14|Launch then take rest|22|Day retrospective

Then pin this into your room's wall. It's better to plan your week at the start of the week.

## Slices and tasks

Every slice has about 1 hour of time. But you should spend something around 45 minutes on each task.
you should spend around 7.5 minutes having rest or walking around after each task, 2.5 minutes reporting your task to your manager if necessary. And 5 minutes of wasting your time :).

Mins|Task
--|--
45|Spend time on the task
7.5|Take rest or walk around
5|Waste it
2.5|Report or retrospective

### Day retrospective

At the end of each day make an hour to review your day, do what's left off and plan for next day. Retrospectives help you to keep your motivation, alalyze your performance and and learn from your mistakes.

### Me time

Me time is a time for you. Don't plan for it. Just if you are in that time stop your tasks (any task) and do nothing. Then decide something fun to do. Doing nothing, playing or listening music, going for a walk, etc.

## Task achievement

Be realistic in your planning and make time for potentially unexpected events or thought. Make time for everything.
If you achieved 85-95% of your plans, you are good to go. But if you scored less than that, you must do something serious to fix your problems. If you scored 100% there is something wrong with your timing.

### Task management tips

- Do not make alot of to-dos for later. Note them down and do them little by little. In my example gathered alot of information to put on this wesite, but I felt lazy to put all the information here. It was better for me to post little information step by step as soon as I found something good to say instead of gathering bombastic articles.

## Tips

- Make use of alarms.
- Try to sleep about 45 mins to 1 hrs after launch.
- There is a website named [Sleepyti.me](https://sleepyti.me/) which can help you to arrenge your sleep time.
- Get enough sleep. 6-8 hours in a day.
- Take Me times, retrospectives and sport serious. Otherwise you might loose your track.
- Make time for working out it helps your mind work better.
- Try to split slices into two parts : Flexible and mandatory. I personally try to put my work and education and things which are not flexible such as gym into my mandatory part of timesheet, while I have alot of flexile time for my self doing extra study, playing guitar etc on my lovely flexible hours.
- Try diverse tasks to get an idea about how many slices that they might take. Improve your time predictions.
- Make 1 hour free time in the middle of your mandatory part. There might be delays or unexpected tasks to put in.
- Social networks are evils.

### A good morning habit

- After you wake up, don't use smart phones. It makes your brain a mess.  Use the 3 second technique and get off from bed.
- Make your bed after you wake up. Because it makes your mind disciplined. It's the first task done. If you don't do these little things right, how do you expect to do the big things right.
- Excersise every morning. If you have time for Facebook, telegram, Twitter and Instagram, you will have time to exercise.
- Whole you are drinking your tea or coffee in the morning, visualize your day. How your day will look like. Note that breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
- Do not bombard or distract your self in the morning by trying something new irrilevent to your tasks. Such as listening to a new record. This might badly distract you.
- And it's good to have a none-distractive me time in the morning.
- You need fun as well. PLEASE PLEASE Make time for it otherwise it will distract you and you'll loose track.

### What if we lost track

I tend to lose my daily rhythm and routine when I am suffering from:

#### Lack of total happiness

#### Lack of sleep

We all need an adequate amount of rest and sleep to keep ourselves energized enough to fulfill the rest of our commitments and to really enjoy life to the fullest on a daily basis.  However, sleep is usually the first thing I sacrifice when I am trying to do too much.  Evaluate whether or not you are getting enough rest, and make adjustments.

#### Lack of ‘me’ time

Because of my quiet, self-reflective nature, I need to be alone on a regular basis.  If you have an introverted nature, you probably need the same thing.  Taking some time for yourself allows you to recharge and come back with more to offer those around you.  Even if you are not an introvert, taking some time to reflect on your life on a regular basis is a healthy thing to do.

#### Lack of healthy food

Most of us are aware that the fuel we put into our bodies will greatly affect the output and quality of life we get out.  Eating healthy meals is another area that is often sacrificed when we are too busy rushing day to day, too tired in the morning to make a good breakfast, or burned out by dinnertime and just end up grabbing something to go.  Whether you prepare meals on the weekends for the weeknights and mornings, or enlist the help of others in your home to help cook each day, healthy meals are crucial to the success of keeping your daily rhythm intact.

#### Lack of exercise

Exercising regularly provides increased serotonin levels, which keep us upbeat and much more likely to feel positive and desire to keep to our schedule and rhythms.  Finding the time to exercise regularly can be tricky at times, but it is worth the effort as the benefits are unmatched.  If you don’t have time for a full workout each day, alternate between working out and an after dinner walk on other days.

#### Lack of time with loved ones

Just as having time alone is something we all need, healthy relationships with those we love is also just as important.  When other areas of life get in the way, and time spent with your spouse, children, other family members and friends suffer, relationships can strain, and life in general gets out of balance.  Keeping relationships balanced should be a priority.

#### Ask yourself these four questions:

- What time is it right now?
- Based on your original schedule, where should you have been at this time?
- What should you have been doing at that location?
- How much time do you have until your next appointment or meeting?

It’s extremely important to know exactly how much time you have available to you over the course of the next few hours. You’ll be better able to plan the remainder of your day.
