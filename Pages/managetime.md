# Time management

The most valuable thing that we have in our life is out time. Here is a tip to manage your time more effectively.

## Divide your day into hourly slices

Assume that you wake up at 7 AM and you sleep at 11 PM. then you have 16 slices of time to work. Assign tasks and missions to each slice and make a worksheet like this:

`#`|Task|`#`|Task
--|--|--|--|--
7| Take pills, Take shower, breakfast|15|Work: (The task you have)|
8|Drive work|16|Work: (The task you have)|
9|Work: (The task you have)|17|Drive home|
10|Work: (The task you have)|18|Take rest - work out|
11|Work: (The task you have)|19|Practice guitar|
12|Work: (The task you have)|20|Watch blah blah movie|
13|Work: (The task you have)|21|Read that book|
14|Launch then take rest|22|Dinner|

Then pin this into your room's wall. It's better to plan your week at the start of the week.

## Slices and tasks

Every slice has about 1 hour of time. But you should spend something around 45 minutes on each task.
you should spend around 7.5 minutes having rest or walking around after each task, 2.5 minutes reporting your task to your manager if necessary. And 5 minutes of wasting your time :).

Mins|Task
--|--
45|Spend time on the task
7.5|Take rest or walk around
5|Waste it
2.5|Report or retrospective

## Task achievement

Be realistic in your planning and make time for potentially unexpected events or thought. Make time for everything.
If you achieved 85-95% of your plans, you are good to go. But if you scored less than that, you must do something serious to fix your problems. If you scored 100% there is something wrong with your timing.

## Tips

- Try to sleep about 45 mins to 1 hrs after launch.
- Make time for working out
