# Laziness

You forget things? Don't trust your mind, use tools and papers

Laziness is a choice, discipline yourself. Just fucking do it. Sometimes it's not important what you feel, it's important that what you do.

## Why we are lazy

1. Because we are happy with dreaming while doing nothing
2. We hate work
3. Technology makes us lazy
4. We haven't got the full control of our life

> Stop dreaming or stop being lazy.

>Say it honestly, I want to ruin my life with laziness.

> I will do this after this video, bullshit, I will do that next week, bullshit, I'll start tomorrow, bullshit!! Stop lying yourself.

## What to do

1. Accept your full control on your life
2. Be your parent, be your boss, push yourself.
3. Understand why you procrastinate, try to debug yourself.
