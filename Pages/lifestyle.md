Means a making a better person of yourself. Means to develop your financial status. And making yourself happy with your life.

## Unsuccessful people

There are two types of unsuccessful people who always suck:

- The people who want to fix their problems but they do not know the methods and techniques
- The people who know what they need to know but they enjoy being lazy

So what divides a loser and a successful person? The answer is easy. The way they look into the world and the way they manage time. So if you wanna be successful, just build up your mindset and discipline yourself.

What's your long term goals ? I mean what you gonna be in 20-30 years?
What is your top 10 values ?
Where are you in the cycle ?
When is the last time you had a vacation?

Understand life cycle

Habits are the key. You need to develop more successful habits. 
Baby steps ...
Stop thinking and start acting 
Stop mental masturbation and act
Action determines losers and winners of the life
Just go fucking do it, don't wait for a trick. Videos ain't gonna help much. Just put your mind sticked to it.
Stop saying yourself lazy, we can act sometimes in a lazy way because of our life cycle but we are not lazy. Laziness is an excuse.
Sometimes it's not important what you feel, what matters is that you move your ass.
Don't be perfectionist. Sometimes you must do half ass.

## Media is a lier

## Creativity

What is creativity and what is not creativity

artistic view

## Problems

We are all human, so all have problems. But what losers do is to be sad and depressed, listening to sad music, insulting everyone and looking for death and waiting to be born again. Or maybe waiting an imaginary day that everything turns into a wonderland. If you do think like this, you are no more than a sucker; You need to change. But if you have a friend who is like this, try to help him/her but if he/she persisted on his/her action, leave her/him alone otherwise you'll be like that person.

## Friendships and connections

I think we are an abstract of the people who we have around us. So choose ones who you wanna be like them. You might wanna pass your current friends and lok for newer ones; That's OK.

## Signs that show that your not mature

Maturity is not gained by age. Some people become mature in their early years of their life, while some others don't become mature at all.
Let's look at some signs that tells you that you are not mature:
1. You are reactive : you let external events to distract you and your performance. While mature people are determined.
You are what you are today because of the decisions that you made in past.
You are what you do.
2. You care too much about your appearance. studies shown that these people mostly suck at work and college.
There is one beautiful child in the world and every mother has it.
3. You are defensive: you just want to explain and make excuse. Let it go and take responsibility.
4. They are victim cards. They have bad parents, unfair boss, bad wife, bad looking, bas education or all. They tell others I'm bad to make them sempathy. They think their life their problem. They are not looking for solutions. While strong and mature people solve their own problems and also help others. People gonna hate victim cards.

3. Schedule reviews.
To remember what we've learned, we need to commit information to our long-term memory. A great way of doing this is by reviewing information regularly.

To review information, revisit learning material straight after you've learned it, using an effective reading strategy.

Also, write notes about what you've learned using tools such as Mind Maps, and then review this information one day, one week, and one month later. You can then revisit the information every few months.

## I always hear music inside my head. What's wrong with me?

There's nothing wrong with you.This “music” playing in your head is a very normal thing for a music lover( assuming you are one). Now for the stopping part-

First and foremost, DO NOT try to stop it or turn it off.See, the problem with this approach is that you wanna be free of this “Music” and in order to do so,you resort to suppressing it but when you try to suppress it you somehow end up focusing on this very same “Music” and the entire cycle of this “Music” playing kicks in again. It's like a minefield where you have to avoid stepping on a mine,only this time this “Music” is the mine and any contact with it whatsoever will result in its explosion.

The solution:

1. The next time this “Music” pops into your head, do NOT try to make it go away. Just don't. Instead, focus on the sound, the song ,listen to it, watch any mental images that may arise. Most importantly, watch these things WITHOUT judging them. You don't judge…just let it come and let it go. As the time passes, you'll begin to feel liberated. This my friend is how you begin meditating.

2. Don't wanna meditate,no problem.You can write down what's going on in your head onto a piece of paper and describe the situation. Writing usually helps a lot when it comes to clearing up your mind from a lot of clutter.

I however would recommend a combination of the two. Begin by writing down the stuff going on in your head and then observe it without judging it.

And above all, DO NOT try to make it go away.

Hope this helps.

Good luck.
